## Features

* **Edit Notes:** Notes are editable directly within the application.
* **Delete Notes:** Users can delete notes by clicking the delete icon within each note.
* **Persistent Storage:** Notes are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is closed or refreshed.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Dark Mode:** Has two modes to lessen eye strain.
